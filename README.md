# ☁️ GCP Learning Notes

This repository is my personal documentation of learning **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, structured day by day.  

Each day contains:
- ✅ Key concepts I studied  
- 🛠 Hands-on exercises I tried  
- 💡 Reflections and takeaways  

The goal is to track my progress and build a solid foundation in GCP services, while creating a portfolio of my cloud learning journey.

## 📌 Why GCP?
- Strong focus on **data analytics, AI, and machine learning** with tools like BigQuery and Vertex AI.  
- Google’s global network ensures **high performance and reliability**.  
- Provides modern developer-friendly services (Kubernetes, serverless, APIs) that are widely used in startups and enterprises.
