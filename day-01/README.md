# Day 01 – Fundamentals of Cloud & Introduction to GCP

## What I Learned
- **Cloud Computing Basics**:  
  Traditional data centers required heavy investment in servers, racks, cooling, and system administrators.  
  Cloud computing solves this by providing resources (compute, storage, networking) as a service.  

- **Challenges of Traditional Setup**:  
  - High upfront cost for servers and maintenance.  
  - Underutilization of resources (paying for capacity even when idle).  
  - Need for system administrators to manage upgrades, patches, and networking.  

- **Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud**:  
  - *Public Cloud*: Providers like AWS, Azure, GCP maintain global data centers; customers pay only for what they use.  
  - *Private Cloud*: Organizations (banks, financial institutions) run their own data centers due to sensitive data.  
  - *Hybrid Cloud*: Mix of both—sensitive workloads on private infra, general workloads on public cloud.  

- **Why GCP?**  
  - Proven scalability & performance: Gmail and YouTube already run on GCP.  
  - Competitive with AWS & Azure; differences lie in implementation, performance, and integration.  

## Hands-on
- Learned how to create a **GCP Free Tier account**.  
- Benefits:  
  - $300 free credits (valid for 90 days).  
  - Always-free services (e.g., 1 f1-micro VM, 5GB storage, BigQuery, Cloud Run).  
- Explored **GCP Console** and **Cloud Shell** for managing resources.  
- Understood that billing only applies beyond free tier usage.  

## Key Vocabulary (Day-1 Familiarization)  
- **Virtualization**: Breaking down a physical server into multiple virtual servers (VMs).  
- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: A software-based emulation of a physical server.  
- **API**: Application Programming Interface for programmatic access to GCP services.  
- **Region**: A geographic area with multiple data centers.  
- **Availability Zone (AZ)**: Individual data centers within a region for redundancy.  
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle more requests by scaling infra.  
- **Elasticity**: Auto-scaling resources up or down as demand changes.  
- **Agility**: Ability to adapt quickly to changing requirements.  
- **High Availability (HA)**: Keeping applications online almost 100% of the time.  
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues to operate even if hardware/software fails.  
- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: Backup & recovery strategy in case of system failure.  
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers for reliability.  

## Reflection
Day-01 provided the foundation for understanding cloud computing, the differences between traditional infrastructure and cloud, and why GCP is a strong choice. I also created my free GCP account and explored the console. With these basics, I’m ready to dive deeper into core GCP services.
